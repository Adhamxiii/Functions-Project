# Functions Project ðŸ¥¸

This project includes a collection of JavaScript functions that perform various calculations and operations. It is designed to showcase different functions and their outputs in an interactive manner. The functions cover a range of tasks, from simple mathematical operations to character and string manipulations.

## Usage

The project presents a web page with a collection of functions and their corresponding input fields. To use a function, follow these steps:

1. Locate the function you want to test on the web page.

2. Provide the required inputs in the input fields. The input types vary depending on the function:

- For most functions, enter numeric values in the input fields.
- For functions like "Summary" or functions related to grades, enter comma-separated numbers in the input fields.
- For functions like "Is Vowel," enter a single character in the input field.

3. Click the "Calculate" button next to the function to execute it.

4. The output will be displayed below the input fields, showing the result of the function.

## Function Descriptions

The project includes the following functions:

1. **Simple Print**: Takes a number as input and returns a message with the number.

2. **Is Divided by 3 and 4?**: Checks if a number is divisible by both 3 and 4.

3. **Max Number**: Compares two numbers and returns the larger one.

4. **Positive or Negative**: Determines if a number is positive or negative.

5. **Max and Min**: Takes three numbers as input and returns the maximum and minimum values.

6. **Even or Odd**: Checks if a number is even or odd.

7. **Is Vowel**: Checks if a character is a vowel.

8. **Print All Numbers**: Prints all numbers from 1 to the given input number.

9. **Multiple Table up to 12**: Generates the multiplication table for a given number up to 12.

10. **Even Numbers**: Lists all even numbers up to the given input number.

11. **Power**: Calculates the power of two given numbers.

12. **Summary**: Takes comma-separated numbers as input and returns the total, average, and percentage.

13. **Days in Month**: Returns the number of days in a given month.

14. **Calculate Grad**: Calculates the grade based on the average of given grades.

15. **Num Days Of Month**: Returns the number of days in a month using a switch statement.

16. **Check Vowel**: Determines if a character is a vowel or consonant using a switch statement.

17. **Maximum Number**: Compares two numbers and returns the larger one using a switch statement.

18. **Even or Odd Number**: Determines if a number is even or odd using a switch statement.

19. **Is Positive or Negative**: Determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero using a switch statement.

20. **Simple Calc**: Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using two numbers and an operator.

## Note

Ensure that all inputs are valid before running the functions to avoid unexpected results.

Feel free to explore and test different functions to see their outcomes!
